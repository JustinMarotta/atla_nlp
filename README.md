Avatar: The Last Airbender NLP Experiments
==============================

1. Perform web scraping, tokenization and preprocessing from scratch 

2. Implement sentiment analysis to gain insights into the show's storytelling from a psychological perspective

    -Showcase how each character's sentiment/emotion changes over the course of the show (Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, Iroh) 

3. Leverage Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to identify most similar episodes

4. Predict character spoken dialogue using Word2Vec and Neural Network architecture


Future:

-Finetune LSTM & transformer architectures on processed transcripts for dialogue prediction

-Compare dialogue prediction with and without sentiment and learned topics as features
